                    <h4>Take advantage of market inefficiencies from time to time:</h4>
                    <p>
                        We have a ‘Contrarian’ approach and bad news might be good news for us. The market at times over reacts to a ‘bad news’. A company might have had a bad quarter or gone through restructuring or recently announced a spin-off and market might be too pessimistic about it. This might lead to a low valuation for an otherwise excellent business, and this would be the right time for us to invest in the business.
                    </p>

                        <p>During the financial meltdown, many exceptional businesses were available at a very cheap discount. Political changes or natural disasters have a similar effect, when markets could over react and great businesses available at a bargain. We are always looking for these opportunities.</p>
                        <h4>Focus on Small /Mid- Cap companies:</h4>
                        <p>
                            The companies with Market Cap of less that US $10 Billion have higher probability of being neglected or escaping the radar of big mutual funds. They are more likely to be unattractive or unexciting business for bigger funds and therefore more likely to be priced below their intrinsic value.

                        </p>
                        <h4>Invest in US Listed Companies:</h4>
                        <p>
                            The economy of United States is the world’s largest and its GDP is also the largest, approximately a fifth of world. It is home to 29.6 million small businesses, 30% of the world's millionaires, 40% of the world's billionaires, as well as 139 of the world's 500 largest companies are in America.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            The market cap of US is about 15 trillion with over 5,000 companies to choose from. As an added advantage, the US market is very well regulated and accurate information on companies available quite easily. Reliable and timely availability of financial data is key to thorough analysis and therefore, a preferred market of investing for Drona.
